## Roadmap

- [x] Setup Simple Node.js Expressjs Server
- [x] Setup MongoDb Database
- [x] Structure server with MVC pattern
- [x] MongoDb functionality complete
- [] PostgreSQL functionality complete
- [] Test PostgresSql Database. With dependency injection, can hopefully switch between MongoDb and PostgresSql seamless
- [] Implement Dependency Injection to allow for different implementations of the same interface but need to research typescript for interfaces since es6 js interface not supported yet
